# eXtended Shell
An easy-to-use Bash recreation project for Windows 7+.

eXtended Shell is designed to be portable and ran under unusual conditions (thus doesn't rely on stuff like `system()`, etc.)

New features are being ported, mainly the ones that I miss from the GNU toolkit.


# Nightly support
Nightly releases are in-development releases not designed to be stable, but features from them *will* eventually make it in the stable release.
If you find a bug, make a pull request.
